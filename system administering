*Fixing Corrupted Bootloaders & Rebuilding UEFI Boot Partitions**
Is your Windows machine failing to boot with errors like "Boot Device Not Found", "Invalid Partition Table", or a black screen of death? I specialize in diagnosing and repairing:

Corrupted Bootloaders *(bootrec /fixboot, bootrec /rebuildbcd)....**
UEFI Boot Partition Reconstruction *(bcdboot, diskpart)....**
MBR/GPT Conversion & Recovery....
Windows Recovery Environment *(WinRE)* Repairs....

## SEE HOW I FIXED A UEFI Bootloader ISSUES IN JUST LESS THAN 10 MINUTES!!!

First if you encounter issue like this: A blue screen of death.

#**Preparing for Repair: Creating a Windows Install USB**
First, I accessed Windows recovery tools when the recovery partition is inaccessible, a Windows install USB is required. 
Within the tool, I accept the user agreement, selected the option to "Create installation media", chose "USB flash drive", and followed the prompts to complete the process.

I backed up the user BCD (Boot Configuration Data) file by using Command Prompt.

*Inside Command Prompt, I useD DiskPart to assign a drive letter to the UEFI partition, which typically lacks one*
Typed diskpart, then list disk to identify Windows installation disk (usually a GPT partition)....
Selected the disk using sel disk [disk_number] (e.g., sel disk 0)....
Typed list vol to find the UEFI partition, which is usually around 100MB, formatted as FAT32, and has no drive letter....
Selected this volume using sel vol [volume_number] (e.g., sel vol 1) and assign it a letter with assign letter=[anyletter] (e.g., assign letter=T)....
Typed exit to leave DiskPart...
Navigated to the assigned UEFI drive (e.g., T:) and confirmed the presence of EFI, Microsoft, and Boot directories....
Formatted the UEFI partition by typing format [UEFI_drive_letter]: /FS:FAT32 (e.g., format T: /FS:FAT32) and confirm the data destruction....






Here is a flowchart illustrating the steps to repair a broken UEFI bootloader:
